# [Better Ballstreams](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams)
Better Ballstreams transforms your Ballstreams view into a theater mode with the video feed enlarged and placed on the left and with the chat vertically maximized and placed to the right. It simply adds a new button to the left of the "TrueView" button and when you click it, it will bring you to a "theater" view with the video enlarged and to the left and with the chat vertically maximized and to the right. You can find this script on Greasy Fork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams).

##Compatibility
I've only tested this script with Chrome 42, but I believe it should support all other modern browsers as well.

##Notes
I added this because I like to be able to see the chat and the game at the same time, but the default view's video was too small and the chat window sucks in every way possible. Hopefully you will find this useful, too. 

Better Ballstreams is intended only to work with the TrueLive view and the DVR view, so you will not see the blue button when you're on any page other than those two.
