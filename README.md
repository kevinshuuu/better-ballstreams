# [Better Ballstreams](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams)
Better Ballstreams transforms your Ballstreams view into a theater mode with the video feed enlarged and placed on the left and with the chat vertically maximized and placed to the right. It simply adds a new button to the left of the "TrueView" button and when you click it, it will bring you to a "theater" view with the video enlarged and to the left and with the chat vertically maximized and to the right. You can find this script on Greasy Fork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams).

##Compatibility
I've only tested this script with Chrome 42, but I believe it should support all other modern browsers as well. The script currently does not support transforming the DVR view into theater mode, so for now it only allows you to transform the TrueLive view.

##Notes
I added this because I like to be able to see the chat and the game at the same time, but the default view's video was too small and the chat window sucks in every way possible. Hopefully you will find this useful, too. 

So far I've only really tested it for specifically just the default TrueLive view. I know it doesn't work for the DVR view and will get around to adding support for that maybe during tomorrow's games, but for now I figure most people are watching in TrueLive view and I typically watch in that view, too, so that was the #1 priority. Feel free to comment on how jank the code is.

##Future
Will try to add more support for the various views on Ballstreams (such as the Live DVR mode and the On-Demand mode for when the games are over). I will probably only develop this whenever I'm watching a basketball game. :^)
