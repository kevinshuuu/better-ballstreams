# Better Ballstreams
Better Ballstreams transforms your Ballstreams view into a theater mode with the video feed enlarged and placed on the left and with the chat vertically maximized and placed to the right.

##Compatibility
I've only tested this script with Chrome 42, but I believe it should support all other modern browsers as well. The script currently does not support transforming the DVR view into theater mode, so for now it only allows you to transform the TrueLive view.

##Other
This script exists on [Greasy Fork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams).
