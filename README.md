# [Better Ballstreams](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams)
Better Ballstreams transforms your Ballstreams view into a theater mode with the video feed enlarged and placed on the left and with the chat vertically maximized and placed to the right. You can find this script on Greasy Fork [here](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/9720-better-ballstreams).

##Compatibility
I've only tested this script with Chrome 42, but I believe it should support all other modern browsers as well. The script currently does not support transforming the DVR view into theater mode, so for now it only allows you to transform the TrueLive view.

##Future
Will try to add more support for the various views on Ballstreams (such as the Live DVR mode and the On-Demand mode for when the games are over). I will probably only develop this whenever I'm watching a basketball game. :^)
